# 2AppAssignment
This is the assignment from 2App Team for the interview process. 
###### At this branch
I migrate the whole code-base to Kotlin. I used
* Kotlin Hilt
* MVVM
* View Binding in this migration.

Sadly, I remove the feature of showing image url as gif,svg, png, jpeg and other extensions. Because I don't want boiler plates Glide extension codes in the project. But I had to implement some features for my current joband I don't really got much time.Surely I will use Coil in the coming update.
